# Drive Transfer Service

[!IMPORTANT]
Start the deployment of the Drive Transfer Service by following the instructions in the [Drive Transfer Service Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ioy9hy2mnJ59H51HhmFPYgiFztP9DhAr1-3oB9Z9KhQ/edit?resourcekey=0-AoapA4opWGxTxQyOdS3CVw&pli=1&tab=t.bkczq8e6eby6)

[!IMPORTANT]
After initially cloning this repository, check out the `bootstrap` branch as your starting point. The `main` branch is populated with values related to another GCP project and it will be difficult to replace them with values for your own project. When you push the code to your own source code repository, you may push to the `main` branch.
